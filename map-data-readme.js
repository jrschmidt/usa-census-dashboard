// Map data correlated to the US Census from 1790 to 2010. Data for each
// decennial census includes all states admitted at that time. Latitude and
// longitude data, as well as dot size (5 pixels for small states, 10 px for
// others) is the same in each census year. What varies for each state from
// one year to the next is the color of its dot on the map. The dot color
// represents the percentage change for a state since the previous census.
//
// Colors are:
// #adbdcc if this is the state's first census.
// #cca3b1 for states that lost population since the last census.
// #0068cc for states with the largest percentage gain in population.
// #297ccc for states with moderate percentage gain in population.
// #5290cc for states with the smallest percentage gain in population.
